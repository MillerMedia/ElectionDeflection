# ElectionDeflection

ElectionDeflection is an iOS app that filters out unwanted political messages using Apple's SMS filtering feature. 

## Why Open Source?

ElectionDeflection has been open-sourced to promote transparency and trust. By making the source code available, I aim to ensure users that their privacy is respected and that no data is being transmitted or stored outside of their device. While you are welcome to load the app onto your device through Xcode, I encourage you to support the project by purchasing it from the App Store. Your support will help continue the development and improvement of this app.

## Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. ElectionDeflection does not save, transmit, or share any of your personal data. All filtering happens locally on your device.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the community! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or ideas for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
